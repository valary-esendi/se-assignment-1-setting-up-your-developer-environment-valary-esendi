Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. 
   step 1. go to your browser of choice and copy the link given.

  step 2. select the windows 11 you are  comfortable with as shown in the diagram below
  ![alt text](<step 2.PNG>) 
  for me i choose that with a windows 11 multi edition ISO for a 64 bit device. (this is a virtual machine as my laptop ocould not meet the requirements for upgrading to windows 11)
  step 3. you choose the language which you want for the windows. for me i choose english(united states as its the deffault language in my laptop). the step is illustrated below in a diagram.

  step 5. after downloading windows 11. go to downloads and run the downloaded file which should be named "windows 11.iso"
  step 6.install the windows 11 directly from he ISO file
  step 7. follow the procedure which will propmt you during installation so as to complete the installation process.


2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   step 1. go to your browser of choice and copy the link above. then it will bring you to a webpage where you can download visual studio as shown below
   ![alt text](image-1.png)
   step 2. download the visual studio code for windows as shown below
   ![alt text](image-3.png)
   step 3. go to your downloaded file and search the downloaded file of visual studio as shown below
   ![alt text](image-4.png)
   step 4.install the visual studio code to your laptop and follow the promps during installation eg of a prompt is where the vs code will be located.
   step 5. after installing the visual studio, copy the path of vscode and then go to the environmental setup where you will add the vs code path to your laptop as shown below
   ![alt text](image-5.png)
   step.6 open the visual studio so as to launch as a visual studio interface showing "welcome to visual studio code" will be displayed. 
   step 7. add the extensions needed for your workflow environment. 


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   step1. browse on your web server and download git in your computer as shown below
   ![alt text](image-6.png)
   step 2. choose download git for windows and it will take you to the following page
   ![alt text](image-7.png)
   step3. click on the "click here to download" icon. git will be downloaded.
   step 4. go to downloads and locate git as shown
   ![alt text](image-8.png)
   step 5. install git on your laptop.
   step 6. open git and run as an administrater.
   step 7. create a github account as shown below
   ![alt text](image-9.png)
   step 8. initialize a git repository and make the first commit as shown below
   ![alt text](image-10.png)

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
   step1.copy the link above and go to your browser as shown
   ![alt text](image-13.png)
   step 2. download python to your laptop and go to your downloads and search for python as shown
   ![alt text](image-14.png)
   step 3. install python in your laptop
   step 4.nstalling Python Compilers and Runtimes:
   the python compiler and interpreter come hand i handy with the python package and so there is no need of installing python compilers and interpreters separately. this is ensured by opening the command prompy or git and then type "python --version" . as shown
    ![alt text](image-15.png)
    step 5. install an IDE(Intergrated Development Environment) in my case i installed visual studio code.



5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   in this case open your command prompt to see if you have pip if not you might need to install it as shown

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   step 1.copy the link given to your browser as shown
   ![alt text](image-17.png)
   step 2. download the mysql that  is at thebottom thatis the second one.

   ![alt text](image-36.png) after this step you will be done will your setup



7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
   in my case i did not set up the development environments and virtulization.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
   the extensions installed in my laptop are shown in the diagram below;
   ![alt text](image-37.png)
9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    as illustrated above. i have documented each software that i have installed to set up my development environment. the steps have included the configurations, customizations and troubleshooting encountered during installation of the softwares. 
    -clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered:
    the only challenge i faced during installation is that this link eg http://wwww.python.org is not working and so i had to resolve it by searching manually on my browser.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
